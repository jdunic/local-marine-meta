#### The relationship of initial richness and log ratio is not biased

This simulation demonstrates the relationship between initial richness and the proportion of change when the average proportion of change is 

How much do we need to be concerned that the log ratio calculation includes SppR1? Does this matter if we are taking a predictive approach? Because if SppR1 is valuable as a predictor then the mechanism for why shouldn''t matter.

```{r}
s_df <- data.frame(t1 = rpois(100, 30))
s_df$change <- exp(rnorm(100, 0, 0.2))
s_df$t2 <-  s_df$t1 * s_df$change

hist(s_df$change)
plot(t2 ~ t1, data=s_df)


plot(log(t2/t1) ~ t1, data=s_df)
```
