#### Unweighted analyses

Within the subset of the data for which we had variances associated with richness, these reported variances range from less than 10-5 to 1, which violates the assumption of identically distributed variables meaning that confidence intervals estimated from an unweighted analysis can be invalid [1]. Additionally, the relationship between sample size and variance was highly non-linear (figure S4), indicating that sample size was a poor proxy for study variance. However, for completeness we also present the results of an unweighted analysis.

#### Leave-one-out analysis 

To test whether our data were robust to the exclusion of a single study, we performed a leave-one-out analysis. The results of the model that included three specific drivers of local richness change were not however, robust to the exclusion of the single study D&#237;ez [2]  (figures S5 - S8, table S8). Leave-one-out analyses revealed that D&#237;ez's [2] report of diversity change of seaweeds in the Bay of Biscay had a substantial effect on the parameter estimates for cumulative human impacts, nutrient addition, and invasion potential (figures S5-S8, table S8). D&#237;ez [2] was a notable study as it had the site associated with the highest nutrient enrichment values (32.9 mt fertilizer / km^2) and the highest invasion potential (158,635 mt shipping traffic / km^2). Thus it was important in extending the range of variability in our predictors and increasing the power of our analysis. Furthermore, including D&#237;ez [2] increased our study's ability ot reflect the true distribution of drivers across the globe. Only with the inclusion of D&#237;ez [2], did our analysis span the range of drivers observed globally in coastal areas (figure S10).

```

### Appendix 3 - Study selection criteria

We excluded studies with inconsistent sampling effort because richness estimates are sensitive to sampling effort (e.g., 3). Sampling methods were considered consistent if the sampling gear used and the number of subsamples was identical between time points.  However, we included studies with non-permanent plots, but that sampled the same 'site', because for larger taxa like fish trawls and marine mammal surveys, exact and permanent transects are often not appropriate or feasible.  We also excluded studies if rare species were not counted, but studies were retained if there was systematic exclusion of a taxon type or group of species (e.g., macroalgae) as it should not have biased trends. Additionally, we excluded a survey of groundfish [4] that included the entire west coast of the United States because it was an outlier relative to the spatial extent of the other studies included in the analysis and thus could not truly be called "local" scale (1900 km2 versus 139 km2 for the next largest site).

Most importantly, we excluded sites if an a priori event was described by authors as affecting a site because we were primarily interested in testing whether variation in a select few human impacts was sufficient to explain the direction and magnitude of biodiversity change at local scales.  Therefore, the inclusion of studies with a priori identification of very localized stressors (e.g., hypoxia, sedimentation) or management actions (e.g., fishing closures, cessation of pollution or eutrophication) would likely introduce noise into our geospatial analysis, which necessarily relies on course-grained (1 km2 to 1 degree grids) estimates of human impacts. Moreover, these studies were inconsistent in their first measurement of biodiversity, with it occurring before, during or after the local impact, yielding unreliable information for our approach. We therefore excluded one hundred ninety-four sites because authors explicitly identified an a priori 'event' (e.g., dredging, marine protected area creation) as potentially affecting the community surveyed. For the remaining data, we contextualized local biodiversity change using an independent evaluation of human impacts [5]. In studies where biodiversity was measured in manipulative experiments, we extracted data only from the control plots that were never manipulated and only used as a reference for the experimental plots.
